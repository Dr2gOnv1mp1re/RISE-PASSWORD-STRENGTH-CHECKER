# RISE-PASSWORD-STRENGTH-CHECKER
 Project 2: Password Strength Checker  Problem Statement:  Weak passwords are a major reason for data breaches.  Objective:  RISE  RISE  Develop a GUI-based tool that analyzes passwords and provides  strength feedback and improvement suggestions.



🔐 Password Strength Checker - GUI Application
📖 Project Description
This project is a simple and intuitive password strength checker built with Python and Tkinter.
It allows users to enter a password and instantly receive strength feedback along with practical suggestions for improving their password security.

🎯 Objective
The goal of this tool is to help users create stronger, more secure passwords by analyzing:

Password length

Character variety (lowercase, uppercase, digits, special characters)

Common weak patterns

By encouraging stronger passwords, this tool contributes to reducing risks associated with weak or easily guessable passwords.

✨ Features
🔍 Real-time password strength analysis

📏 Checks for:

Minimum length (8 characters)

Lowercase letters

Uppercase letters

Digits

Special characters (e.g., !, @, #)

✅ Displays user-friendly feedback and improvement tips

🎨 Color-coded results:

Green text for strong passwords

Red text for weak passwords with suggestions

🖥️ Simple and clean GUI built using Tkinter

⌨️ Supports Enter key for quick checks

⚙️ How to Use
Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python password_checker.py
Enter your password in the input field.

Press the Enter key or click the Check Strength button.

Review the feedback and improve your password as needed.

🔧 Requirements
🐍 Python 3.x

📦 Libraries used:

tkinter (GUI)

string (for character checks)

✅ All libraries are built-in; no external installation is required.

⚠️ Limitations
Does not check against real-world compromised password lists.

Focuses only on basic password structure rules.

Designed as a learning project, not as an enterprise-grade security tool.

🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)
Add progress bars or visual strength indicators.

Integrate with breached password databases like HaveIBeenPwned.

Add password visibility toggle (show/hide).

Support password strength scoring systems like zxcvbn.
